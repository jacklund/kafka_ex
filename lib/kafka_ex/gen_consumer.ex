defmodule KafkaEx.GenConsumer do
  @moduledoc """
  A behaviour module for implementing a Kafka consumer.

  A `GenConsumer` is an Elixir process that consumes messages from Kafka. A single `GenConsumer`
  process consumes from a single partition of a Kafka topic. Several `GenConsumer` processes can be
  used to consume from multiple partitions or even multiple topics. Partition assignments for a
  group of `GenConsumer`s can be defined manually using `KafkaEx.GenConsumer.Supervisor` or
  coordinated across a cluster of nodes using `KafkaEx.ConsumerGroup`.

  ## Example

  The `GenConsumer` behaviour abstracts common Kafka consumer interactions. `GenConsumer` will take
  care of the details of determining a starting offset, fetching messages from a Kafka broker, and
  committing offsets for consumed messages. Developers are only required to implement
  `c:handle_message/2` to process messages from the queue.

  The following is a minimal example that logs each message as it's consumed:

  ```
  defmodule ExampleGenConsumer do
    use KafkaEx.GenConsumer

    require Logger

    def handle_message(%Message{value: message}, state) do
      Logger.debug("message: " <> inspect(message))
      {:ack, state}
    end
  end
  ```

  `c:handle_message/2` will be called for each message that's fetched from a Kafka broker. In this
  example, since `c:handle_message/2` always returns `{:ack, new_state}`, the message offsets will
  be auto-committed.

  ## Auto-Committing Offsets

  `GenConsumer` manages a consumer's offsets by committing the offsets of acknowledged messages.
  Messages are acknowledged by returning `{:ack, new_state}` from `c:handle_message/2`.
  Acknowledged messages are not committed immediately. To avoid excessive network calls,
  acknowledged messages may be batched and committed periodically. Offsets are also committed when a
  `GenServer` is terminated.

  How often a `GenConsumer` auto-commits offsets is controlled by the two configuration values
  `:commit_interval` and `:commit_threshold`. These can be set globally in the `:kafka_ex` app's
  environment or on a per-consumer basis by passing options to `start_link/5`:

  ```
  # In config/config.exs
  config :kafka_ex,
    commit_interval: 5000,
    commit_threshold: 100

  # As options to start_link/5
  KafkaEx.GenConsumer.start_link(MyConsumer, "my_group", "topic", 0,
                                 commit_interval: 5000,
                                 commit_threshold: 100)
  ```

  * `:commit_interval` is the maximum time (in milliseconds) that a `GenConsumer` will delay
    committing the offset for an acknowledged message.
  * `:commit_threshold` is the maximum number of acknowledged messages that a `GenConsumer` will
    allow to be uncommitted before triggering an auto-commit.

  For low-volume topics, `:commit_interval` is the dominant factor for how often a `GenConsumer`
  auto-commits. For high-volume topics, `:commit_threshold` is the dominant factor.

  ## Callbacks

  There are three callbacks that are required to be implemented in a `GenConsumer`. By adding `use
  KafkaEx.GenServer` to a module, two of the callbacks will be defined with default behavior,
  leaving you to implement `c:handle_message/2`.

  ## Integration with OTP

  A `GenConsumer` is a specialized `GenServer`. It can be supervised, registered, and debugged the
  same as any other `GenServer`. However, its arguments for `c:GenServer.init/1` are unspecified, so
  `start_link/5` should be used to start a `GenConsumer` process instead of `GenServer` primitives.

  ## Testing

  A `GenConsumer` can be unit-tested without a running Kafka broker by sending messages directly to
  its `c:handle_message/2` function. The following recipe can be used as a starting point when
  testing a `GenConsumer`:

  ```
  defmodule ExampleGenConsumerTest do
    use ExUnit.Case, async: true

    alias KafkaEx.Protocol.Fetch.Message

    @topic "topic"
    @partition 0

    setup do
      {:ok, state} = ExampleGenConsumer.init(@topic, @partition)
      {:ok, %{state: state}}
    end

    test "it acks a message", %{state: state} do
      message = %Message{offset: 0, value: "hello"}
      {response, _new_state} = ExampleGenConsumer.handle_message(message, state)
      assert response == :ack
    end
  end
  ```

  Invoked for each message consumed from a Kafka queue.

  `message` is a message fetched from a Kafka broker and `state` is the current state of the
  `GenConsumer`.

  Returning `{:ack, new_state}` acknowledges `message` and continues to consume from the Kafka queue
  with new state `new_state`. Acknowledged messages will be auto-committed (possibly at a later
  time) based on the `:commit_interval` and `:commit_threshold` options.

  Returning `{:commit, new_state}` commits `message` synchronously before continuing to consume from
  the Kafka queue with new state `new_state`. Committing a message synchronously means that no more
  messages will be consumed until the message's offset is committed. `:commit` should be used
  sparingly, since committing every message synchronously would impact a consumer's performance and
  could result in excessive network traffic.

  Invoked to determine partition assignments for a coordinated consumer group.

  `members` is a list of member IDs and `partitions` is a list of partitions that need to be
  assigned to a group member.

  The return value must be a map with member IDs as keys and a list of partition assignments as
  values. For each member ID in the returned map, the assigned partitions will become the
  `assignments` argument to `KafkaEx.GenConsumer.Supervisor.start_link/4` in the corresponding
  member process. Any member that's omitted from the return value will not be assigned any
  partitions.

  If this callback is not implemented, the default implementation by `use KafkaEx.GenConsumer`
  implements a simple round-robin assignment.

  ### Example

  Given the following `members` and `partitions` to be assigned:

  ```
  members = ["member1", "member2", "member3"]
  partitions = [{"topic", 0}, {"topic", 1}, {"topic", 2}]
  ```

  One possible assignment is as follows:

  ```
  ExampleGenConsumer.assign_partitions(members, partitions)
  #=> %{"member1" => [{"topic", 0}, {"topic", 2}], "member2" => [{"topic", 1}]}
  ```

  In this case, the consumer group process for `"member1"` will launch two `GenConsumer` processes
  (one for each of its assigned partitions), `"member2"` will launch one `GenConsumer` process, and
  `"member3"` will launch no processes.
